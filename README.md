# Titanic Data Using Decision Tree Algorithm

## 📘 Overview
This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using the **Decision Tree Algorithm**. 
It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset
The Titanic dataset is available in **Seaborn**. It includes details like age, gender, class, fare, and survival status of passengers.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

## ⚙️ Steps Involved
1. Load and explore the dataset from Seaborn.
2. Handle missing data and prepare features.
3. Train a Decision Tree model.
4. Evaluate accuracy and visualize results.

## 🧾 Results
The model successfully predicts passenger survival based on features such as age, gender, and passenger class.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
